## Summary

This project was written in Python 3.x and meant to be run in a crontab on MacOS.

_Note: it will automatically 'prune' the Pictures/Background/ directory so that
only 20 backgrounds are saved at one time. It will log any files removed via this process
in a removal_log.txt file in the code directory._

### Update 9/28/2017
With the release of the Unsplash Wallpaper App, this script is irrelevant and
eats up unnecessary space on my local HD. I'm no longer using it, but keeping it
here for posterity.
