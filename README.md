## Summary

This project was written in Python 3.x and meant to be run in a crontab on MacOS.

_Note: it will automatically 'prune' the Pictures/Background/ directory so that
only 20 backgrounds are saved at one time. It will log any files removed via this process
in a removal_log.txt file in the code directory._
